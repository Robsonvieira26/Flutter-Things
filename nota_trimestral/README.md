# nota_trimetral
This was my first app made (excluding the ones made during Udemy and YouTube courses) and is very basic.
It's counts with some digit inputs and made a calculation with those inputs and shows to the user.
In this case, the calculation result is a trimester grade, based in the grade system of the school that I studied during High School.

### Main knowledges from this app:
* Use and decoration of TextFields
* Simple validation of TextFormFields
* Simple calculation to show a value to the user
