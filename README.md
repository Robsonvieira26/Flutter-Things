# Flutter Things
This repository contains some apps and project that I made with Flutter framework during my studies.
At this moment, there are two apps made:

## nota_trimetral
This was my first app made (excluding the ones made during Udemy and YouTube courses) and is very basic.
It's counts with some digit inputs and made a calculation with those inputs and shows to the user.
In this case, the calculation result is a trimester grade, based in the grade system of the school that I studied during High School.

## github_repos
This app have the objective to receive a input from the user, a name of a github user, and show the public repositories of that user, along with some information, such as stars, forks, and so on.
